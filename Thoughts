componentDidMount() {
  this.callApi()
    .then(res => this.setState({ response: JSON.stringify(res[0]["categories"].find(item => item.name = "Pre Burger"))}))
    .catch(err => console.log(err));
}

If the above code sets the state to only Pre-Burger why does this not achieve the same thing and throws an error:

<Category {this.state.response.find(item => item.name = "Pre Burger")} />

This is the question that has impeeded my progress with this tech test and unfortunatly I have been unable to find a solution,
